# Herding_in_PGG
This repository contains the code to replicate the experiments and results presented in the paper "Herd Behaviour in Public Goods Games". 

The "Code" folder contains the code of the four models in the papers as well as the code to replicate all the figures in the paper.
The "Simulation Data" folder contains the raw data resulting from the simulations. The data is organised in 5 columns:
  · round: Public Goods Game round 
  · contribution: categorical in {0,2,4,6,8,10} that represents different contributions to the public goods, from nothing to all (see details in the paper)
  · frequency: frequency of agents choosing to contribute the quantity in the "contribution" column
  · mean: average contribution of the group in the round (round column)
  · replicationNumber: replication identifier
